       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                ¾ cup honey teriyaki sauce
            </li>

            <li>
                ¼ cup white wine
            </li>

            <li>
                4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
            </li>

            <li>
                16 spears fresh asparagus
            </li>

            <li>
4 slices Swiss cheese
            </li>
        </ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        In a large bowl, mix the honey teriyaki sauce and wine. Place chicken in the bowl, and coat with the marinade. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour (it is best if you can marinate overnight).
    </li>

    <li>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    </li>

    <li>
        Discard marinade, and arrange chicken breasts in a baking dish. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until almost done.
    </li>

    <li>
        Place the asparagus in a pot fitted with a steamer basket over 1 inch of boiling water, and steam 5 minutes, until tender.
    </li>

    <li>
        Place 4 asparagus spears on each chicken breast, and top each breast with a slice of Swiss cheese. Return to oven, and continue baking 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and chicken juices run clear.
    </li>
